<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The idea of this project was the search of a very specific painting. I remember to have seen a very similar painting to the ones this generator can create, but I don't remember what it was called. But I know, that I liked its simplistic style paired with its seemingly random distribution of colors.

During my efforts of searching for that painting I thought about recreating it myself, so I implemented this simply painitng generator and added a few themes for the generation process. 

The colors are generated using random samples of different normal distributions.

The following to paintings have been generated using the winter and rainbow theme.

  <img float="left" src="/img/winter.png" width="250" />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img float="right" src="/img/rainbow.png" width="250" />

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

Generally, you have two main options. 

If you want to generate paintings immediatly, you can do so using [this link](https://fabian-kruse.github.io/modernArt/src/index.html).

Otherwise, if you want to add your own color palettes or play around with the code you might want to clone this repository as follows:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fabian-kruse/modernArt
   ```
2. If you now simply click on the /src/index.html file you can run the generator in your browser.
 
Enjoy!
